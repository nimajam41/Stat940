# Stat940 - Course Project

This is our project for the STAT940 course at the University of Waterloo in Winter 2024. In this project, we extended some pre-existing adversarial attack methods for generating adversarial images to the realm of 3D point clouds. We evaluated the success rates of these attacks against two different classification networks, as well as several 3D defense algorithms. For more details, please refer to the [PDF report](https://github.com/nimajam41/Stat940/blob/main/stat940_Project.pdf) in this repository.
